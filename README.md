# Analyzing-Car-Reviews-with-LLMs

The CTO at "Car-ing is sharing", a car sales and rental company, hired you to help prototype a chatbot app that addresses diverse inquiries using LLMs. She proposed you piloting the following tasks:

Use a pre-trained LLM to classify the sentiment of the five car reviews in the car_reviews.csv dataset, and evaluate the classification accuracy and F1 score of predictions.
Store the model outputs in predicted_labels, then extract the labels and map them onto a list of {0,1} integer binary labels called predictions.
Store the calculated metrics in accuracy_result and f1_result.
The company is recently attracting customers from Spain. Extract and pass the first two sentences of the first review in the dataset to an English-to-Spanish translation LLM. Calculate the BLEU score to assess translation quality, using the content in reference_translations.txt as references.
Store the translated text generated by the LLM in translated_review.
Store the BLEU score metric result in bleu_score.
The 2nd review in the dataset emphasizes brand aspects. Load an extractive QA LLM such as "deepset/minilm-uncased-squad2" to formulate the question "What did he like about the brand?" and obtain an answer.
Use question and context for the two variables containing the LLM inputs: question and context.
Store the actual text answer in answer.
Summarize the last review in the dataset, into approximately 50-55 tokens long. Store it in the variable summarized_text.
